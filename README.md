## Frontend Nanodegree Flashcards Project
This is my solution to the flashcards project of the react nanodegree from Udacity. The project is to build a self quizing app.
The app is built using react native. Redux is used for state management. The following were the criterias that had to be met
for this project.
##### Specific Requirements
Use create-react-native-app to build your project.
Allow users to create a deck which can hold an unlimited number of cards.
Allow users to add a card to a specific deck.
The front of the card should display the question.
The back of the card should display the answer.
Users should be able to quiz themselves on a specific deck and receive a score once they're done.
Users should receive a notification to remind themselves to study if they haven't already for that day.
### Installation
To get the project running on your local machine firstly take a clone of this repo onto your local machine. Then `cd` into the
root directory on your CLI tool(eg. CMD prompt or Terminal) and then run `npm install`. This will install all the node packages
you require to run the project.
```
npm install
```
### How to Run
The project is bootstrapped with create react native app. You can follow the below mentioned methods to run the website
depending on the build you prefer.
 _Note:_ `cd` into the root folder on your CLI tool and then run the commands.
To run the devolopment build with auto reload use the following command:
```
npm start
```
Download and install expo app from the app/play store. Open the app once installed and scan the qr code generated in the CLI.
### How to Build for production
To get the production build use the following command from the root folder:
```
Android: exp build:android
Ios: exp build:ios
```
This command will optimize the files and output a download url link on the CLI. Use the link to download the installation
package file.
### Tests
The app was tested on both android and IOS platforms.
